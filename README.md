# Computer-Graphics-Lab
This repository contains implementations of various computer graphics algorithms and techniques, developed as part of a Computer Graphics course. The aim of this project is to gain practical experience in applying theoretical concepts to real-world graphics applications.

### For Setup Environment:
1.Download and install `code blocks v17.12` & `glut 3.7.6`

2.from glut folder -->
>copy `glut32.dll` to `C:\Windows\System32` [if 32 bit]
>copy it to `C:\Windows\SysWOW64`

>copy `glut32.lib` to `C:\ProgramFiles(x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\lib`

>copy `glut.h` to `C:\ProgramFiles(x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\include\GL`

### Codeblocks Build Option:
(1) file > new > project > `GLUT project` > set a project title > select glut location:`C:\ProgramFiles(x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW` > Finish.

(2) Click in project title > build option > linker settings > click `add` > select this path `C:\ProgramFiles(x86)\CodeBlocks\MinGW\lib\glut32.lib` > ok.

(3) click `Build and Run`
